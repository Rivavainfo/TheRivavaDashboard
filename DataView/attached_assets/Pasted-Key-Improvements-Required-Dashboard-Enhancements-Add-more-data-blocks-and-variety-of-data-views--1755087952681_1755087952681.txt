Key Improvements Required:

Dashboard Enhancements:

Add more data blocks and variety of data views (e.g., trend analysis, category breakdown, comparison charts, heatmaps, KPI summaries, percentage growth, anomalies detection).

Integrate AI-powered data analysis that automatically detects patterns, trends, and insights from the dataset and displays them as insights cards on the dashboard.

Ensure the dashboard works with both CSV uploads and live Firebase Firestore connections.

Fix CSV Upload:

The current CSV upload option is not working — make sure it parses correctly, validates the file format, and updates the dashboard instantly with the uploaded data.

Handle large CSV files efficiently without freezing the UI.

Export PDF Improvements:

The current PDF export output is too basic — improve it so the exported PDF is beautifully formatted with:

Charts, tables, and KPI cards presented in a clean, readable layout.

Professional header/footer with logo, date, and page number.

Turquoise, black, and white color scheme maintained in the PDF.

UI/UX Overhaul:

Make the UI one of the best in the industry:

Use a modern, professional design inspired by premium SaaS dashboards (e.g., sleek cards, micro-animations, shadows, smooth transitions).

Maintain turquoise (#40E0D0), black (#000000), and white (#FFFFFF) as the main palette.

Fully responsive design that looks perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Clear typography hierarchy and spacing for better readability.

Add subtle hover effects, interactive elements, and polished animations for a premium feel.

General Requirements:

Keep CSV and Firebase data sources interchangeable — user should be able to switch without refreshing the whole page.

Implement real-time updates for Firebase data.

Provide clear error messages and loading states for all data operations.

Goal: The final dashboard should be a professional-grade analytics tool with advanced data visualization, AI insights, flawless CSV upload, and a world-class UI.
